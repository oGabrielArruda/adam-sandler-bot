ðŸ“ƒ Description
-------------
Adam-sandler-bot is a Twitter bot, that replies every mention with a joke and a Adam Sandler photo. 
After running the script, it will stay searching mentions. Once a mention is found, it generates the joke using a web API, according to the required language.
We use the Python library Tweepy to access the Twitter API, and also to interact with it.
Currently, it's deployed in [Pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
